### Troubleshooting Multiscale Deformable Attention Installation (MSDA)
Code updates I had to make (should already be implemented):
* change `type()` to `scaler_type()`

Additional steps I had to follow to install MSDA:
* Update my Windows drivers through the NVIDIA App (previously called GeForce Experience) and restarted my PC
  * According to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaHVsZa2jTc&ab_channel=NVIDIADeveloper) windows drivers automatically apply to WSL as well
